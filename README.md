## Design Philosophy: "Effortless Elegance"

The interface is designed to feel like a high-end **Italian Architectural Studio** rather than a generic SaaS tool.
Key aesthetic choices include:

- **Typography**: _Space Grotesk_ (Headings) for structural impact, paired with _Satoshi_ (UI) for modern readability.
- **Palette**: **Olive Green** (`#4A5D23`) accents grounded by **Warm Cream** (`#F4F4F0`) backgrounds.
- **Materials**: Glassmorphism (`backdrop-blur-xl`) and subtle gradients evoke transparency and light.

## Features

- **Studio Composer**: Upload site photos and draft landscape visions using AI.
- **Comparison Slider**: Interactive before/after slider to demonstrate value to clients.
- **One-Click Proposals**: Generate photorealistic renders instantly.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface for on-site presentations.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Animation**: Framer Motion
- **Interaction**: React Dropzone, Lenis (Smooth Scroll)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Type**: Fontshare CDN (Space Grotesk, Satoshi), Google Fonts (JetBrains Mono)
